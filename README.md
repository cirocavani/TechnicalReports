> Hi folks,
>
> TL;DR
>
> - About: My work translating a TensorFlow (python) tutorial about Speech Recognition to Julia Programming Language
> - Audience: Anyone interested in an End-to-End ML example using Deep Learning in Julia
> - Out of scope: introducing speech recognition / ASR / ML
>
> ...
>
> Do you know Julia, the best programming language ever?
>
> Do you know you can use Julia to visualize data, train a model and then run a bunch of inferences with it?
>
> If you answered no to any of these questions and you are curious / intrigued about them, give it a try.
>
> In this technical report, I translated a TensorFlow tutorial that shows how to process audio files to train a Deep Learning model (CNN) to identify a command label from the audio. This report shows data manipulation, data visualization, Deep Learning model definition, model training, model evaluation / confusion matrix and an inference code to run with the exported model. Itâ€™s an End-to-End ML example using Deep Learning in Julia.

> The first image shows the input data and the second image shows the probability for each class and the last image shows the confusion matrix of the trained model.
>
> My code is an interactive Pluto notebook that you can run yourselves locally (just install Julia, clone my repo and start Pluto using julia start_pluto.jl at the project folder).
